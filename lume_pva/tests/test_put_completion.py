"""Put-completion tests for :class:`lume_pva.runner.Runner`.

Relies on multiprocessing.Event gates to track the exact state of the model
in the Runner.

Rough flow:
1. Issue the put on a background thread.
2. Wait until the simulation has entered ``_set`` (so the value was delivered
   and dequeued by the runner).
3. While the gate is still closed, assert the put has **not** returned -- this
   is the property that breaks if put-completion is removed (the client would
   be signalled immediately).
4. Open the gate, let the simulation finish, and assert the put now returns.
5. Confirm the output PV already holds the freshly computed value, proving the
   put waited for the whole cycle

Two EPICS providers are exercised:
- PVA via ``p4p``
- CA via ``pyepics``

Runners are started up in independent subprocesses to ensure each test gets a
fresh Runner.
